Carlo: describe a model and generate a list of events using this model
=====

    First of all he cut hairs on the log, then the forehead, the the eyes...

    Suddenly the eyes opened themselves and stared at him...

    Carlo gave no sign that he's frightened, just asked gently:

    â€“ Wooden eyes, why do you look at me so strange?

    -- Aleksey Nikolaevich Tolstoy, "The Golden Key, or the Adentures of Buratino"

Although Papa Carlo was just a street organ player, his most famous achievement was creation of Buratino, speaking wooden doll. Using `carlo` you could also create (random) events following the described model.
